Saudi National Day is a public holiday in Saudi Arabia celebrated annually on 23 September to commemorate a proclamation that renamed the Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932 through a royal decree by King Abdulaziz al-Saud. It is one of the three non-religious national holidays observed in the country.
